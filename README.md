Module 2 Python challenge
Finished python challenge with two folders, PyBank and PyPoll.
  Both folders contain a python script, along with a resources folder containing initial csv data and an analysis that contains text output of the analysis.
  PyBank contains profit and loss data from a company, recorded across a set of 86 months. Analysis contains the total net change in profit/loss, as well as the average change across months. 
  Furthermore, it contains the greatest increase and decrease in profit/loss and the months in which they occurred.
  PyPoll contains election data of 3 candidates. Analysis contains the total amount of votes each candidate recorded, the percentage of votes they earned, and who the winning candidate was.
